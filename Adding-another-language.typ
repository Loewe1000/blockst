To add another language, you just have to copy and modify "lang/en.typ" for example, add the corresponding lines in registry.typ and add the options at the end of lib.typ.

For now, you also need to do more : else if {} in scratch.typ for the functions :
- wenn-ich-als-klon-entstehe
- wiederhole
- wiederhole-bis
- wiederhole-fortlaufend
- falls

You can also add an "examples-short-" file to show examples for you language.
